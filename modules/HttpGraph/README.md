## HTTP Graph

[HTTP Graph](https://gephi.org/plugins/#/plugin/httpgraph) is a plugin for [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) which lets you build a graph of web relationships as you browse.  Data is collected by a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/http-graph-collector/lkkdeokncfjlinldgikoabgknklnnkoe) and sent to the plugin via REST.  It can also collect this data by acting as a proxy server but due to the prevalence of HTTPS these days, it's not as effective as when this was written in 2010.
